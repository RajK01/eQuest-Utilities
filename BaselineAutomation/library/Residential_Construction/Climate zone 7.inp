$ Construction Types as follows:
$ 	Walls - Steel Framed
$ 	Roofs - Insulation entirely above deck
$ 	Windows - Simplified Glass calculates so that the U-factor in .SIM file matches with 90.1 2007 Tables 5.5-1-8
$ 	Underground walls - a common sense approach was taken. Appendix A describes a procedure but the underground wall
$ 		subsequently would not be a lightweight assembly. A 3" concrete wall with adjusted conductance was used to avoid being a "mass wall"
$		as defined in the footnotes of Table A3.1B
